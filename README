Build and Install Instructions
-------------------------------------------

1) Edit Rules.make file and set appropriate paths

2)  Build SDK Using -
     $ make OMAPES=X.x (see make help for more info)

     Ex:

	$ make help

	Usage (for build): make BUILD={debug | release} OMAPES={5.x | 6.x}
	      Platform                                   OMAPES
	      --------                                   ------
	      AM35x                                       3.x
	      OMAP37x/AM37x                               5.x
	      816x(389x)/814x(387x)                       6.x
	      OMAP4/AM45x                                 7.x
	--> Specifying OMAPES is mandatory. BUILD=release by default

	Usage (for install): make BUILD=(debug | release} OMAPES={3.x | 5.x | 6.x | 7.x} install
	--> See online Graphics Getting Started Guide for further details.


4) Install the SDK into File system using:
     $ sudo make OMAPES=X.x install

(This copies the *.so and *.ko to file system pointed to by TARGETFS_INSTALL_DIR variable).


Note: In Case of AM389x platforms Syslink and VPSS modules need to be built.
